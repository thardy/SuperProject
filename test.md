Last update: 26 Feb 2013

[Markx] is a Markdown editor specifically designed for academic and scientific authoring. It highlights several advantages of Markdown (plain-text, multiple format conversion, easy version control) while still supplying the basic features which are a must for academic publications (citations, math rendering, layouts).

### Writing Markdown
[Markdown] is a markup language.

Markdown is very easy to learn and there are many online tutorials, just use Google.

#### Markdown Flavor
You should use **Pandoc-flavored Markdown** as both converters ([Pandoc] and [Docverter] use that). The HTML preview on the right is processed using [PageDown], so there could be some thing it doesn't process like Pandoc does (found something? open an [issue]).
